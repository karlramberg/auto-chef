Auto Chef was an entry into the 2019 PickHacks hackathon at Missouri University of Science and Technology. It uses a custom algorithm based on Markov chains to generate combinations of foods that could be prepared into a meal. It starts totally random but slowly learns which combinations would be tasty based on the user's feedback.
